# FEA_base
 Basic functionality for finite-element analysis.
 
 This library implements basic finite-element functionality for Matlab, including
 * Fast vectorized assembly of sparse matrices and load vectors
 * Setting Dirichlet boundary conditions
 * Easy visualization of solutions
 
 The class-based library is designed to be as extendable as possible, with e.g. new element types and shape functions possible by 
 subclassing the corresponding base classes.
